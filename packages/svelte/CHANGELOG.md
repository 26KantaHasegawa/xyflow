Svelte Flow alpha is here ðŸ”¥ You can expect some changes until we reach 1.0.0 but we try to stick as close as possible to the React Flow API. There are no docs yet, but we are working on it! For now the easiest way is to use the autocomplete of your IDE, lookup the props in the SvelteFlow component or check out the React Flow docs. 

This very first release comes with lots of features already:

- pass `nodes` and `edges` as writables 
- draggable, selectable and deletable nodes 
- support for custom `nodeTypes` and `edgeTypes`
- basic viewport settings like `fitView`, `minZoom` and `maxZoom`
- additional components: `<MiniMap />`, `<Controls />` & `<Background />`
