# @xyflow/system

Core system that powers React Flow and Svelte Flow.

## Installation 

```sh 
npm install @xyflow/system
```

## What is this package about?

The @xyflow/system package was created to have a place for vanilla utils for React Flow and Svelte Flow. The package exports helpers for edge creation, pan and zoom, dragging of nodes, general utils and lots of types. All the helpers are specifically built for React Flow and Svelte Flow so it's probably not too interesting to use them with other libraries.
